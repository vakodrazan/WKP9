Hey team!
After a major graded project, let's do something different, and a little bit more straightforward.
Today weâ€™re going to build a list of the Studio Ghibli Movies, ranked from best to worst. If you havenâ€™t seen any of those, I suggest you to look on the Onja hard drive! (after completing the project of course). They are amazing âœ¨

The website will look similar to this :

![assets/ghibli.png](assets/ghibli.png)

You will fetch the data from this URL [https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films)

and display the result in the HTML. The film needs to be sorted depending on their rt_score!

There is a lot of data in a film object, use whatever attribute you need.

Feel free to add some beautiful styling to your website when you're done fetching and sorting the data.

Good luck ðŸ’»
